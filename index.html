            <P class="paragraphR"> "Al Dente" is a way of cooking pasta to the correct texture to allow for in sauce cooking or to prevent over cooking at a later time. Although not always the texture preferred to everyone, if you boil the pasta to this state then continue to cook your pasta in the sauce, baking pasta, or preparing ahead for later heating it will keep it from being over cooked.

         <p class="paragraphL">
            "Battonet" is a thick cut commonly called "french fry cut" it literally translates to "small stick". It is a cut that has the dimensions 1/4 inch x 1/4 in x 2 inches roughly the size of a small pinky finger. Although it has many application I have mostly used this cutting vegetables for snacking, fries and roasted vegetables.

            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
               "Coring" is the process of removing the seeds or center portion of an item. Depending on what the item is it can be fairly simple or rather difficult, if thinking "I don't know how to do this" look it up, avocado related injuries sent an average of 24 people to the hospital a day in 2021. It is usually done to allow an item to be cut easier (ie - mangoes, avocado), remove distasteful portions (ie - Apples, pears) or to stuff with other items (ie - stuffed zucchini/cucumber).

            <h2 class="paragraphHeaders"> Deep Fry</h2>
            <p class="paragraphL">
               Deep Frying is the act of completely submerging an item in very hot oil. It creates a hard shell around the inside trapping the center while heating it through saturating the outer layers with fat. It can be done in a deep deep fryer or in a high sided pot at home, although if attempting to try at home be sure to look up the best safety practices and have a fire extinguisher nearby.
