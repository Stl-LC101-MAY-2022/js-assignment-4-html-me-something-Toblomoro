            <p> "Al Dente" is a way of cooking pasta to the corrcet texture to allow for in sauce cooking or to prevent over cooking at a later time. Although not always the texture preferred to everyone, if you boil the pasta to this state then continue to cook your pasta in the sauce, baking pasta, or prepareing ahead for later heating it will keep it from being over cooked.
